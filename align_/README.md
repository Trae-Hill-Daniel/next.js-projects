## The Problem We Solve

In any active marketing team, campaign names can quickly become inconsistent. Names like `SummerSale_2025`, `summersale`, or `London-Summer-Promo` all refer to the same campaign but are a nightmare for reporting. This leads to fragmented data, inaccurate analysis, and wasted time trying to manually group campaigns together.

**Align_** was built to solve this exact problem. By providing a single source of truth for campaign naming and UTM link creation, it ensures every campaign is logged perfectly from the start.

## The Core Builders

Align_ offers three distinct tabs, each tailored for a specific workflow.

### 1. Quick Builder: For Speed and Automation

This is your go-to for most standard campaigns. It's designed to be fast and efficient, automating as much as possible.

**How to use:**
* Enter your campaign details in the form. A preview of the standardized campaign name will be displayed automatically.
* Copy the generated name for use in your CRM and other platforms.
* To generate UTM links, toggle the **"Generate UTM Link?"** switch.
* **Note:** A unique UTM link will be generated for **each** marketing channel you have selected, which is perfect for launching a multi-channel campaign all at once.

### 2. Custom Builder: For Granular Control

Use this builder when you need to override the automated UTM settings or have a unique source/medium combination that doesn't fit the standard options.

**How to use:**
* Enter your campaign details to generate the standardized campaign name, just like in the Quick Builder.
* Toggle the **"Generate UTM Link?"** switch.
* Manually enter the specific `UTM Medium` and `UTM Source` in the new form fields that appear.
* A preview of the custom UTM link will be displayed for you to copy.

### 3. URL Builder: For Simple UTM Tagging

Use this builder when you *only* need to create a UTM link and don't need a standardized campaign name. It's perfect for one-off links or ad-hoc tracking.

**How to use:**
* Enter your destination URL and all the required UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, etc.) directly into the form.
* A preview of the final tracking link is displayed automatically.
* Copy the generated UTM link.

## The Naming Convention

The following structure is used by the **Quick Builder** and **Custom Builder** to generate standardized campaign names.

**Structure:**
`[ticketNumber]_[campaignDate]_[productCategory]_[campaignType]_[playerSegment]_[marketingChannels]_[campaignName]`

**Component Breakdown:**

* **`ticketNumber`**: The unique ID from your project management tool (e.g., `JIRA-123`, `ASANA-456`, `CRM-1516` ).
* **`campaignDate`**: The launch date in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `2025_07_10`).
* **`productCategory`**: The primary product being promoted (e.g., `Slots`, `Bingo`, `Sportsbook`).
* **`campaignType`**: The strategic goal of the campaign (e.g., `Acquisition`, `Retention`, `CrossSell`).
* **`playerSegment`**: The target audience for the campaign (e.g., `VIP`, `NewPlayers`, `Lapsed`).
* **`marketingChannels`**: The channel used for distribution (e.g., `Email`, `Social`, `PPC`).
* **`campaignName`**: The specific, human-readable name of the initiative (e.g., `SummerSpins`, `WelcomeBonus`).

**Example Generated Name:**
`CRM_1516_2025_07_10_Slots_Retention_VIP_Email_SummerSpins`

## UTM Generation

The UTM link is automatically generated based on the campaign details, ensuring a perfect 1:1 match between the link and the name in your CRM. The tool intelligently maps your inputs to the appropriate UTM parameters.

* **`utm_campaign`**: The **full, generated campaign name** is used here for precise tracking.
    * e.g., `CRM-1516_20250710_Slots_Retention_VIP_Email_SummerSpins`
* **`utm_source`**: The platform for the channel (a separate input, e.g., `google`, `facebook`, `mailchimp`).
* **`utm_medium`**: Maps directly from the **`marketingChannels`** field.
    * e.g., `email`, `social`, `cpc`.
* **`utm_content`**: Can be used to track audience performance (optional input).
    * e.g., `VIP`, `NewPlayers`.
* **`utm_term`**: Can be used for specific keywords in PPC campaigns (optional input).

**Example Generated Name:**
`https://yourdomain.com?utm_source=email&utm_medium=crm&utm_campaign=CRM_1516_2025_07_10_Slots_Retention_VIP_Email_SummerSpins`
