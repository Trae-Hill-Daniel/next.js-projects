        The Problem We Solve:
      </h3>

      <p className="text-muted-foreground text-balance pb-5">
        In any active marketing team, campaign names can quickly become
        inconsistent. Names like SummerSale_2025, summersale, or
        London-Summer-Promo all refer to the same campaign but are a nightmare
        for reporting. This leads to fragmented data, inaccurate analysis, and
        wasted time trying to manually group campaigns together.

      <p className="text-muted-foreground text-balance pb-5">
        Align_ was built to solve this exact problem. By providing a single
        source of truth for campaign naming and UTM link creation, it ensures
        every campaign is logged perfectly from the start.
